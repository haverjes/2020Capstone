# Diagrams

Most diagrams can be found in our [LucidCharts folder](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/b75dd5a9-3f70-4799-be44-45aff3f822bf).

Due to Jesse's fondness for PlantUML and LucidChart's limited implementation of it, some sequence diagrams will be stored here in .puml  files.  Diagrams are generated in VS Code using the PlantUML extension.
